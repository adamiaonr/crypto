# blockchain
experiments with blockchains, proof-of-work, etc.


## basic implementation

the first part of this project is to implement a very simple crypto currency, which will 
help me better understand the concepts like blockchains, proof-of-work, distributed 
trustless consensus, etc.

the implementation is written in Python, and based on the following tutorials 
by Gerald Nash:

* part 1: [blockchain](https://medium.com/crypto-currently/lets-build-the-tiniest-blockchain-e70965a248b)
* part 2: [proof of work](https://medium.com/crypto-currently/lets-make-the-tiniest-blockchain-bigger-ac360a328f4d)
